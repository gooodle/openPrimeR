# openPrimeR
This is a set of data for testing

Great, Thanks a lot for your willingness to help out.
I made a copy of the folder containing the data set I used to test your script.
The script to run is runMe.Rscript in /R_Script.
My previous run output can be found in /R_outPut, and you can see where it got stuck. 

I am going to design primers for multiplexing PCR and amplicon sequencing. 
Why I am interested in your tool is that openPrimeR allows definition sequence regions for FP and RP designing.
I would like to hear you advice on using openPrimeR to my best benefit.
